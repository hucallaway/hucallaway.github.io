# Private Directory - Development Work

This directory contains content that is not yet ready for public display or is being developed offline.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `development/`
- **Active development files** - Pages and content you're currently working on
- **Experimental features** - New functionality being tested
- **Draft content** - Articles, pages, or sections in progress

### `archive/`
- **Old versions** - Previous iterations of pages
- **Template files** - Original HTML5 UP template files
- **Historical content** - Content that's been replaced or deprecated

### `drafts/`
- **Content drafts** - Articles, blog posts, or other content being written
- **Design mockups** - Visual designs or wireframes
- **Planning documents** - Notes, outlines, and planning materials

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Start in `development/`** - Create new pages and features here
2. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure everything works as expected
3. **Move to public** - When ready, move files to the main directory
4. **Archive old versions** - Move replaced files to `archive/`

## 📝 Guidelines

- Keep sensitive information out of public files
- Use descriptive filenames for easy organization
- Test all functionality before making public
- Document any special requirements or dependencies

## 🚀 Moving to Production

When you're ready to make content public:

1. Copy the file from `development/` to the main directory
2. Update any internal links or references
3. Test the live version
4. Remove the development version or move it to `archive/`
